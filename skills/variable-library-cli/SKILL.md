> 4. Variable Library definition requests must omit the `format` field entirely. Do not send `format: null`.
> 5. **Skill disambiguation**: use `variable-library-cli` for every Variable Library concern, including the Variable Library side of a consumer reference. Deep authoring of the consumer item itself belongs elsewhere: pipelines to `pipeline-migration`, notebooks to `spark-cli`, Dataflow Gen2 to `dataflows-cli`, Git lifecycle to `git-integration-operations-cli`, deployment pipeline mechanics to `deployment-pipelines-authoring-cli`.
> 6. Clarify before creating on an underspecified request. If a "set up / create a Variable Library" request does not name the variables, their types, defaults, and value sets, ask a clarifying question or present structured options before creating anything. Do not fabricate a configuration and silently create the item without confirming intent. (A concrete, fully specified request needs no confirmation.)
> 7. When generating consumer code (notebooks, UDFs) that reads a Boolean Variable Library value, coerce it defensively with `str(value).lower() == "true"`. Never use `bool(value)` on a string: every non-empty string, including `"false"`, is truthy in Python, so `bool("false")` is always `True`.
> 8. Do not write a value set override whose value equals the variable's default. An override pins the value: once written, later edits to the default no longer reach that value set, so a redundant override silently opts the value set out of inheritance. Omit the override and let the value set inherit. Only override where the value genuinely differs.

# Fabric Variable Library -- CLI Skill

This one skill owns Fabric Variable Library items: definitions and value sets, the VL side of consumer references, the active value set item state, and Variable Library CI/CD behavior.

It is a **mode dispatcher** and contains NO procedures. Pick the mode that matches the request from the table below, then **read the matching `references/<mode>.md` file end to end with your file-reading tool BEFORE issuing a single command**. That file holds the endpoints, payload shapes, templates and gotchas; acting without it produces wrong payloads and wrong results.

Read it once per session. A file you have already read stays in context, so do not re-read it on a later turn.

## Mode selection

| Mode | Use when the request ... | Example triggers | Read this first |
|---|---|---|---|
| `authoring` | creates or changes the library definition: variables, defaults, types, value set override files, `settings.json` | create variable library, add a variable, valueSets, variableOverrides, valueSetsOrder, updateDefinition | [references/authoring.md](references/authoring.md) |
| `consumption` | wires a variable into a consumer item, or explains how a consumer resolves it | libraryVariables, notebookutils variableLibrary, pipeline expression, Dataflow Gen2 / copy job / shortcut / UDF / Plan reference | [references/consumption.md](references/consumption.md) |
| `operations` | reads or switches the active value set, or covers stages, Git serialization and deployment | active value set, activeValueSetName, promote to prod, per-stage values, Git diff, fabric-cicd | [references/operations.md](references/operations.md) |

### Mode boundary rule

Classify by **plane**, not by vocabulary. A request that mentions value sets is `authoring` when it changes the override *files* and `operations` when it changes *which* value set is active in a workspace. Creating `valueSets/prod.json` is `authoring`; pointing the prod workspace at it is `operations`.

`consumption` covers the Variable Library side of a reference only. Authoring the consumer item's own definition belongs to that item's skill (CRITICAL NOTES 5).

If a request genuinely spans modes, handle them one at a time and read each reference before you start that part. If the mode is ambiguous after reading this table, ask one short clarifying question instead of guessing.

## Terminal write -- the step you must not skip

Reading the reference and planning the change is NOT completing the task. Each mutating mode ends with one state-changing call. If you did not issue it, nothing was persisted -- say so explicitly rather than reporting success.

| Mode | Terminal write |
|---|---|
| `authoring` | `POST /v1/workspaces/{ws}/items` with `type: "VariableLibrary"` for a new library, or `POST /v1/workspaces/{ws}/items/{id}/updateDefinition` to persist an edit. Both send base64 definition parts and must omit `format`. Building the JSON locally writes nothing. |
| `consumption` | the consumer item's own update call, owned by that item's skill. This skill's deliverable is the correct reference contract to place in it. |
| `operations` | `PATCH /v1/workspaces/{ws}/variableLibraries/{id}` with `{"properties":{"activeValueSetName":"<name>"}}`. This is item state: it does not edit `settings.json`, `variables.json`, or `valueSets/*.json`, and it does not appear in a Git diff. |

Before you report the task done, confirm the terminal call returned success and read the artefact back to prove the change landed. For `operations`, read back with `GET /variableLibraries/{id}`: the generic `/items/{id}` omits `properties` and will not show the active value set.

## Shared essentials (all modes)

Resolve the workspace and item first; every mode depends on it.

| Task | Reference | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Finding Workspaces and Items in Fabric | [COMMON-CLI.md](../../common/COMMON-CLI.md#finding-workspaces-and-items-in-fabric) | **Mandatory** -- read before resolving any workspace or item id |
| Fabric Topology & Key Concepts | [COMMON-CORE.md](../../common/COMMON-CORE.md#fabric-topology--key-concepts) | Item types, workspaces, capacities |
| Authentication & Token Acquisition | [COMMON-CORE.md](../../common/COMMON-CORE.md#authentication--token-acquisition) | Wrong audience = 401; read before any auth issue |
| Authentication Recipes | [COMMON-CLI.md](../../common/COMMON-CLI.md#authentication-recipes) | `az login` flows and token acquisition |
| Fabric REST with `az rest` | [COMMON-CLI.md](../../common/COMMON-CLI.md#fabric-control-plane-api-via-az-rest) | Primary access method for this skill |
| Core Control-Plane REST APIs | [COMMON-CORE.md](../../common/COMMON-CORE.md#core-control-plane-rest-apis) | Pagination, LRO polling, rate limiting |
| Long-Running Operations (LRO) | [COMMON-CLI.md](../../common/COMMON-CLI.md#long-running-operations-lro-pattern) | Create and definition APIs can return 202 |
| VariableLibrary item definition | [ITEM-DEFINITIONS-CORE.md](../../common/ITEM-DEFINITIONS-CORE.md#variablelibrary) | Canonical part paths and field names |
| Gotchas & Troubleshooting | [COMMON-CLI.md](../../common/COMMON-CLI.md#gotchas--troubleshooting-cli-specific) | `az rest` audience, shell escaping, token expiry |

## Rules

### MUST

- Select exactly one mode from the table above before doing anything else.
- Read `references/<mode>.md` end to end, as your FIRST tool call, before the first command of that mode. Read it ONCE, in a single full read: do not re-open it, do not grep it again, and do not page through it. You already have it.
- Resolve workspace and item ids by listing and filtering, never by guessing a GUID.
- Announce a mode switch explicitly when the request crosses a boundary.
- Treat the reference as instructions, never as the deliverable. After reading it, RUN the documented commands against the live workspace and report the real results.
- Use the canonical part names `variables.json`, `settings.json`, and `valueSets/<name>.json`, with `value` for defaults and `variableOverrides` for value set overrides.
- Produce every artefact the user asked for, under the name they used, and keep its heading even when the finding is "none".

### PREFER

- The narrowest mode that satisfies the request.
- Reading exactly ONE mode reference. Load a second only when the request genuinely spans modes, and say so before you do.
- Reporting the mode you chose in your first response so the user can correct you.
- Generating JSON bodies with Python or `jq` so base64 payloads are valid UTF-8 and quoting is stable.
- Recommending `fabric-cicd` for full deployment automation rather than hand-rolling it here.

### AVOID

- Acting from this dispatcher alone -- it intentionally omits the operational detail.
- Stringifying value-set overrides. Each `variableOverrides[].value` must use the variable's NATIVE JSON type; a stringified boolean or number is rejected with `InvalidContent (InvalidValueOrTypeMismatch)` despite the REST doc listing the field as `String`.
- Using `defaultValue`, `values`, or `format` in Variable Library definitions.
- Fabric `fab` CLI command syntax. It exists, but Variable Library command shapes are not verified here.
- Deep-authoring consumer item definitions (CRITICAL NOTES 5).
- Re-reading or re-grepping a reference you already loaded; it costs turns and tokens.

## Examples

| User request | Mode | Reference to read |
|---|---|---|
| "Create a Variable Library with a dev and prod value set." | `authoring` | [references/authoring.md](references/authoring.md) |
| "Wire the target_path variable into my ingest pipeline." | `consumption` | [references/consumption.md](references/consumption.md) |
| "Point the prod workspace at the prod value set after deployment." | `operations` | [references/operations.md](references/operations.md) |
| "Why didn't my Git diff show the value set switch?" | `operations` | [references/operations.md](references/operations.md) |
| "Add a Boolean flag variable, then read it from a notebook." | `authoring`, then `consumption` | both, one at a time |
