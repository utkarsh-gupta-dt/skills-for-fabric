# Git Integration Operations — CLI Skill

Automate the Fabric Git integration lifecycle (connect, commit, update, status,
disconnect) from CLI environments. Whether cross-workspace item references rebind
after promotion is a separate concern, determined by the item definition format
(logical vs object IDs) rather than the Git lifecycle itself.

## Prerequisite Knowledge

Read these shared references first (paths assume this skill lives under
`skills/git-integration-operations-cli/` in `skills-for-fabric`; adjust when drafting
outside the repo):

## Must/Prefer/Avoid

### MUST DO
- Read `git/status` and pass the current `workspaceHead` into every `commitToGit`
  and `updateFromGit` call.
- Poll `git/status` after each async operation until
  `workspaceHead == remoteCommitHash` **and** the `changes` array is empty. A
  `202`/`Succeeded` status is not proof of a correct sync — validate the state.
- Deploy an item together with the items it references in the same commit, so
  logical IDs can resolve inside the target workspace.

### MUST NEVER
- Never run two Git operations concurrently on the same workspace — a second
  `commitToGit`/`updateFromGit` while one is still `Running` corrupts head
  tracking. Serialize: poll the first to `Succeeded` before starting the next.
- Never treat a workspace as both a source of truth **and** a CI/CD push target
  on the same branch. Pick one writer per branch: either humans commit from the
  workspace, or automation pushes to Git — not both at once.

### PREFER
- `fab api` (after `fab auth login`) as the **primary** driver: it sets the base
  URL and Fabric token audience automatically, avoiding the 401 wrong-audience
  trap. Use `az rest` with `--resource "https://api.fabric.microsoft.com"` as the
  **fallback** when `fab` is unavailable or you need fine-grained header control.
- `PreferRemote` conflict resolution for a clean "pull latest from Git" into a
  downstream/target workspace.

### AVOID
- Reusing a stale `workspaceHead` (causes `400 WorkspaceHeadMismatch`).
- Passing request bodies via stdin to `fab api` (use `-i <file.json>` or `-i '<inline JSON>'`).

---

## CLI: `fab` primary, `az rest` fallback

Every operation below is shown with `fab api`. Run `fab auth login` once (it
supports service principals for automation); `fab` then handles the base URL and
token audience for you. The identical call on the `az rest` fallback is a
mechanical translation:

**Authenticate `fab` for the identity you are running as:**

```bash
fab auth login                                              # interactive user (SSO)
fab auth login -u <client-id> -p <client-secret> --tenant <tenant-id>   # service principal (CI/CD)
fab auth login --identity                                   # managed identity (Azure compute)
```

A service principal or managed identity must be workspace **Admin** to connect or
disconnect (at least **Contributor** with write on all items is enough for
commit/update) and (for the `ConfiguredConnection` path) hold the git provider
credentials. See
[references/automation-templates.md](references/automation-templates.md) for full
pipeline scripts.

- `fab api <endpoint>` becomes `az rest --method GET --url "https://api.fabric.microsoft.com/v1/<endpoint>" --resource "https://api.fabric.microsoft.com"`.
- `fab api -X post <endpoint> -i body.json` adds `--method POST --headers "Content-Type=application/json" --body @body.json`.

`fab api` reads a request body via `-i` from either a file path or an inline JSON
string (e.g. `-i '{"displayName":"..."}'`) — never from stdin. It prints
`{"status_code": <code>, "text": <parsed body>}` (add `--show_headers` for a
top-level `headers` object), so read response fields with `jq -r '.text.<field>'`
and the LRO id with `jq -r '.headers["x-ms-operation-id"]'`. See
[Example 2](#example-2-az-rest-fallback-equivalents) for a full `az rest` pair.

## Pre-Flight (before you connect)

Run these Git-relevant checks in order before `git/connect`. Each failure has a
specific fix — resolving them up front avoids the most common connect-time errors.

| Check | Command | Pass = proceed / Fail = fix |
|---|---|---|
| Auth + Fabric token | `fab auth login` then `fab api workspaces` | `401` → re-login (`fab` sets the correct audience automatically) |
| Caller is workspace Admin | `fab api "workspaces/${WORKSPACE_ID}/roleAssignments"` | Connect/disconnect require the **Admin** role |
| Workspace has capacity | `fab api "workspaces/${WORKSPACE_ID}"` → check `capacityId` | `WorkspaceHasNoCapacityAssigned` → assign a capacity (Git requires one) |
| Git credential for the SP path | `fab api connections` (reuse if one already fits) | SP connect needs a `ConfiguredConnection`. If none exists, the skill **creates** it from your ADO org/project/repo + SP tenant/client/secret — see [Create the Git provider connection](#create-the-git-provider-connection-service-principal) (needs the tenant toggle "service principals can create connections"). The interactive-user SSO path uses `Automatic` and needs no connection. |
| Target `directoryName` exists on the branch | GitHub: `curl -fsS -H "Authorization: Bearer $PAT" "https://api.github.com/repos/$OWNER/$REPO/contents/$DIR?ref=$BRANCH"` — ADO: Items API on the repo | The API (unlike the portal) does **not** create a missing folder — connecting to a `directoryName` that doesn't exist fails with `404 GitProviderResourceNotFound`. If the folder is new, pre-create it first (see the note under [Connect a Workspace to Git](#connect-a-workspace-to-git)). |

## Connect a Workspace to Git

Connect a workspace to an Azure DevOps or GitHub repo, then initialize the
connection to establish the sync direction.

```bash
# 1. Connect (Azure DevOps example). Body goes in a file, passed with -i.
cat > connect.json <<'JSON'
{
  "gitProviderDetails": {
    "gitProviderType": "AzureDevOps",
    "organizationName": "myorg",
    "projectName": "MyProject",
    "repositoryName": "fabric",
    "branchName": "main",
    "directoryName": "/workspace-a"
  }
}
JSON
fab api -X post "workspaces/${WORKSPACE_ID}/git/connect" -i connect.json

# 2. Initialize the connection (choose which side wins on first sync)
printf '{"initializationStrategy":"PreferWorkspace"}' > init.json
fab api -X post "workspaces/${WORKSPACE_ID}/git/initializeConnection" -i init.json
```

Use `PreferWorkspace` when the workspace already has the authoritative items;
`PreferRemote` when the Git branch is authoritative.

> **The target `directoryName` must already exist on the branch.** Unlike the Fabric
> portal — which silently creates a missing folder by committing a `README.md`
> placeholder into it — the `git/connect` **API does not create the folder**.
> Connecting to a `directoryName` that does not exist on the branch fails with
> `404 GitProviderResourceNotFound`. The repo and branch must exist too (connect
> never creates a branch). If the folder is new, create it first by committing a
> placeholder file to the branch **through the Git provider's API** (not a Fabric
> API), then connect. Match the portal's convention with a `README.md` whose body is
> `This is an auto-created file via Fabric skills for <workspace-name>`.
>
> ```bash
> # GitHub: create <DIR>/README.md on <BRANCH> (reuse the PAT behind the Git connection)
> DIR="workspace-a"; WS_NAME="My Workspace"
> CONTENT=$(printf 'This is an auto-created file via Fabric skills for %s\n' "$WS_NAME" | base64)
> cat > mkfolder.json <<JSON
> { "message": "Create ${DIR} folder for Fabric Git connect", "branch": "${BRANCH}", "content": "${CONTENT}" }
> JSON
> curl -fsS -X PUT -H "Authorization: Bearer ${GITHUB_PAT}" \
>   "https://api.github.com/repos/${OWNER}/${REPO}/contents/${DIR}/README.md" -d @mkfolder.json
> # Azure DevOps equivalent: POST .../_apis/git/repositories/${REPO}/pushes with an
> # "add" change for "/${DIR}/README.md" on refs/heads/${BRANCH} (same body content).
> ```

> **Two authentication modes (both providers use `myGitCredentials` for automation).**
> A workspace authenticates to git in one of two ways:
> - **Automatic git credential** (Azure DevOps only): the connecting user's SSO
>   identity, established from workspace settings. Secondary contributors with at
>   least Contributor reuse it. Not available for GitHub, and not usable for
>   headless / service-principal automation.
> - **Configured credential** (Azure DevOps *and* GitHub): a Fabric cloud connection
>   referenced in the connect body. This is the required path for any service
>   principal or unattended run:
>   ```json
>   "myGitCredentials": { "source": "ConfiguredConnection", "connectionId": "<connection-guid>" }
>   ```
>   For **Azure DevOps**, the connection's `credentialType` can be either
>   `ServicePrincipal` (headless automation) or `OAuth2` (a stored delegated user
>   token); both are valid ConfiguredConnection credentials per the Create Connection
>   API and both support multitenant scenarios.
>   For **GitHub**, connecting a workspace **requires a Personal Access Token (PAT)**:
>   the cloud connection stores a fine-grained token with Contents Read (plus Write
>   to commit), or a classic token with the `repo` scope. GitHub has no automatic
>   credential mode, so a PAT is mandatory even for an interactive user connect.
> The distinction is not "GitHub needs credentials, ADO does not". ADO *also*
> requires a ConfiguredConnection whenever a service principal drives the connect;
> the automatic mode only covers interactive user SSO. (Learn:
> fabric/cicd/git-integration/automate-git-integration-with-service-principal;
> rest/api/fabric/core/git/connect.)

> **Handle the initialize response.** `initializeConnection` returns
> `requiredAction` (`UpdateFromGit`, `CommitToGit`, or `None`) plus `workspaceHead`
> and `remoteCommitHash`, and can itself return `202`. After it settles, call the
> sync operation named by `requiredAction` with the returned hashes, or the
> workspace stays connected but not fully synced. (Learn:
> rest/api/fabric/core/git/initialize-connection.)

### Create the Git provider connection (service principal)

For unattended automation, first create a Fabric cloud connection that stores the
git provider credentials, then pass its `id` as the `connectionId` in the
`myGitCredentials` block above. Use the
[Create Connection API](https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/fabric/core/connections/create-connection)
(`POST /v1/connections`, delegated scope `Connection.ReadWrite.All`). A service
principal can create the connection only if the Fabric admin setting "service
principals can create workspaces, connections, and deployment pipelines" is on.

**Information you must supply (Azure DevOps):**
- ADO **organization**, **project**, and **repository** names, combined into one
  `url` parameter: `https://dev.azure.com/<org>/<project>/_git/<repo>/`
- The service principal's **tenant ID**, **client (application) ID**, and
  **client secret**
- A connection **display name** (max 200 chars, must be unique in the tenant)

**Prerequisites before the connection will work:** grant the service principal
(a) access to that **Azure DevOps organization and project** (git access is
enforced by ADO itself, not only by Fabric), and (b) **Admin** on the target
Fabric workspace.

```bash
# Create an Azure DevOps source-control connection using a service principal.
# The body holds a cleartext SP secret, so restrict perms and delete it on exit
# (a leftover connection.json can be captured by a later CI step or artifact upload).
trap 'rm -f connection.json' EXIT
umask 077
cat > connection.json <<'JSON'
{
  "displayName": "ado-sp-fabric-cicd",
  "connectivityType": "ShareableCloud",
  "connectionDetails": {
    "type": "AzureDevOpsSourceControl",
    "creationMethod": "AzureDevOpsSourceControl.Contents",
    "parameters": [
      { "dataType": "Text", "name": "url",
        "value": "https://dev.azure.com/<org>/<project>/_git/<repo>/" }
    ]
  },
  "credentialDetails": {
    "credentials": {
      "credentialType": "ServicePrincipal",
      "tenantId": "<tenant-id>",
      "servicePrincipalClientId": "<client-id>",
      "servicePrincipalSecret": "<client-secret>"
    }
  }
}
JSON
fab api -X post "connections" -i connection.json
```

The `201` response returns the connection `id`; use it as `connectionId` in the
`myGitCredentials` block of the connect call. For a fully secret-free variant,
pass the body inline with `-i '{...}'` (no file on disk) or reference a Key Vault
secret via `servicePrincipalSecretReference` instead of the raw
`servicePrincipalSecret`. The example above uses
`credentialType: "ServicePrincipal"`; Azure DevOps connections also accept
`credentialType: "OAuth2"` (a stored delegated user token), and both credential
types support multitenant scenarios. To switch an *existing* user-connected
workspace to a service principal, add the SP as workspace Admin, share or recreate
this connection, then
`PATCH /workspaces/{id}/git/myGitCredentials` with the same ConfiguredConnection
body. (Learn:
fabric/cicd/git-integration/automate-git-integration-with-service-principal;
rest/api/fabric/core/connections/create-connection.)

## Commit to Git

Push workspace items to the connected branch. Read the head first, then commit.

```bash
# Read current head. git/status can return 202 (LRO) with no body — capture the
# status code with --show_headers and poll before reading, or workspaceHead comes
# back as "null" and the commit below fails with a misleading 400.
RESP=$(fab api "workspaces/${WORKSPACE_ID}/git/status" --show_headers)
if [ "$(echo "$RESP" | jq -r '.status_code')" = "202" ]; then
  OP=$(echo "$RESP" | jq -r '.headers["x-ms-operation-id"]')
  until [ "$(fab api "operations/${OP}" | jq -r '.text.status')" = "Succeeded" ]; do sleep 5; done
  RESP=$(fab api "workspaces/${WORKSPACE_ID}/git/status" --show_headers)   # now 200 with body
fi
HEAD=$(echo "$RESP" | jq -r '.text.workspaceHead')

# Commit all pending changes. Build the body with jq so the comment is always
# valid JSON even if it contains a quote, backslash, or newline.
jq -n --arg head "$HEAD" --arg msg "Author items" \
  '{mode:"All", workspaceHead:$head, comment:$msg}' > commit.json
RESP=$(fab api -X post "workspaces/${WORKSPACE_ID}/git/commitToGit" -i commit.json --show_headers)
# commitToGit may complete synchronously (200) or async (202). Only poll when async.
if [ "$(echo "$RESP" | jq -r '.status_code')" = "202" ]; then
  OP=$(echo "$RESP" | jq -r '.headers["x-ms-operation-id"]')
  until [ "$(fab api "operations/${OP}" | jq -r '.text.status')" = "Succeeded" ]; do sleep 5; done
fi
```

Use `"mode": "Selective"` with an `items` array to commit a subset. `commitToGit`
completes either synchronously (`200`, already settled) or asynchronously (`202`
with an `x-ms-operation-id` to poll) — branch on `.status_code` as above rather
than assuming `202`.

## Update from Git

Pull committed items into a workspace (for example, a downstream or target
workspace connected to the same branch/folder).

```bash
# Read both hashes from the target workspace
STATUS=$(fab api "workspaces/${TARGET_WS}/git/status")
TH=$(echo "$STATUS" | jq -r '.text.workspaceHead')
REMOTE=$(echo "$STATUS" | jq -r '.text.remoteCommitHash')

cat > update.json <<JSON
{
  "workspaceHead": "${TH}",
  "remoteCommitHash": "${REMOTE}",
  "conflictResolution": {
    "conflictResolutionType": "Workspace",
    "conflictResolutionPolicy": "PreferRemote"
  },
  "options": { "allowOverrideItems": true }
}
JSON
fab api -X post "workspaces/${TARGET_WS}/git/updateFromGit" -i update.json
```

## Check Sync Status

Poll until the workspace and remote heads match. Both `commitToGit` and
`updateFromGit` are asynchronous, so this loop is how you know they finished.

```bash
for i in $(seq 1 30); do
  S=$(fab api "workspaces/${WORKSPACE_ID}/git/status")
  WH=$(echo "$S" | jq -r '.text.workspaceHead')
  RC=$(echo "$S" | jq -r '.text.remoteCommitHash')
  CH=$(echo "$S" | jq -r '.text.changes | length')
  # Success = heads match AND no residual changes. Heads matching alone can still
  # leave uncommitted/unapplied diffs; validate both before declaring "synced".
  [ "$WH" = "$RC" ] && [ "$CH" = "0" ] && { echo "synced at $WH"; break; }
  sleep 8
done
```

For an operation still in flight (a `202` from commit/update), poll the LRO
directly instead of guessing from heads:

```bash
# Capture x-ms-operation-id from the 202, then poll until Succeeded
OP_ID=$(fab api -X post "workspaces/${WORKSPACE_ID}/git/commitToGit" -i commit.json \
  --show_headers | jq -r '.headers["x-ms-operation-id"]')
while :; do
  ST=$(fab api "operations/${OP_ID}" | jq -r '.text.status')
  case "$ST" in Succeeded) break ;; Failed) echo "op failed"; break ;; *) sleep 5 ;; esac
done
```

`git/status` also returns a `changes` array — a non-empty array means there are
uncommitted (workspace) or unapplied (remote) differences.

## Resolve Conflicts

A genuine conflict is *changed-on-both-sides*: after the last sync, the **same
item** was modified in the workspace (an uncommitted local edit) **and** on the
branch (a new commit). `git/status` flags that item in its `changes` array with
`conflictType: "Conflict"` (both `workspaceChange` and `remoteChange` show
`Modified`). This is distinct from a one-sided diff, where only `updateFromGit`
(remote-only change) or `commitToGit` (workspace-only change) is needed with no
policy.

When both sides changed an item, `updateFromGit` **requires** a conflict policy —
calling it without a `conflictResolution` block returns
`400 MissingWorkspaceConflictResolution`:

- `conflictResolutionPolicy: "PreferRemote"` — the Git branch wins (typical for
  pull-into-target deployment); the local edit is discarded.
- `conflictResolutionPolicy: "PreferWorkspace"` — the live workspace wins; to
  push the workspace version to Git instead use `commitToGit`, which does not
  take a conflict policy.

Set `options.allowOverrideItems: true` to let the update overwrite items that
already exist in the target workspace (required whenever the conflicting item is
already present in the workspace, which it is by definition in a both-sides
conflict).

**Which policy to pick:**

| Scenario | Policy |
|---|---|
| Downstream/target workspace pulls the latest from Git | `PreferRemote` |
| The authoring workspace is the source of truth | `PreferWorkspace` (or `commitToGit` to push the workspace version to Git) |
| Genuine two-sided edits on the same item | Inspect each `changes` entry's `conflictType` in `git/status` and resolve deliberately per item |

## Disconnect from Git

```bash
fab api -X post "workspaces/${WORKSPACE_ID}/git/disconnect"
```

## Link a Branch Workspace to its Base (Workspace Relations)

> **Preview.** The **Git workspace relations** APIs are part of the Fabric Git
> surface and are in preview. They record a lineage link between a **branch**
> workspace and the **base** workspace it was branched from, so the base↔branch
> relationship is visible in the Fabric portal. Use them when a branch workspace
> was created **before** the built-in branch-out feature shipped, or when branch
> workspaces are provisioned by your own **automation** (not the portal branch-out
> UX) and you still want that lineage to show in the UI. Creating a relation does
> **not** connect either workspace to Git, move items, or start a sync — it only
> records the link.

**Precondition — both workspaces must point at the same Git root.** Create fails
with `WorkspaceRelationRootDirectoryMismatch` unless the base and branch workspaces
are connected to the **same repository root**, differing only by branch:

- **Azure DevOps:** same `organizationName`, `projectName`, `repositoryName`, and
  `directoryName` — only `branchName` differs.
- **GitHub:** same repository URL and `directoryName` — only `branchName` differs.

So connect (and initialize) both workspaces to Git first; the relation just makes
the existing branch/base pair visible.

### Create a relation (link branch ↔ base)

The relation is **bidirectional**, so you create it **once**. Read the body
carefully — the workspace you POST to and the `relationType` are two different
things:

- The **URL** workspace (`workspaces/{workspaceId}/...`) is the side you call *from*.
- `relatedWorkspaceId` is the **other** workspace.
- `relationType` describes the role of that **other** (`relatedWorkspaceId`)
  workspace, **not** the workspace in the URL. Only `Base` and `Branch` are valid
  when creating.

So the same single link has two equivalent ways to create it:

| Call from (URL workspace) | `relatedWorkspaceId` | `relationType` |
|---|---|---|
| the **branch** workspace | the **base** | `Base` |
| the **base** workspace | the **branch** | `Branch` |

Do **not** run both — once one direction exists, creating the other fails with
`WorkspaceRelationBidirectionalExists`. Whichever side you call from, the
permission requirement is the same: **Admin on the branch workspace and Contributor
(or higher) on the base workspace.** The recommended (and most intuitive) form is
to call from the branch and point at the base:

```bash
# From the BRANCH workspace, declare that the related workspace is its Base.
printf '{"relatedWorkspaceId":"%s","relationType":"Base"}' "${BASE_WS}" > relation.json
fab api -X post "workspaces/${BRANCH_WS}/git/workspaceRelations" -i relation.json
```

Returns `201`. Service principals and managed identities are supported.

### List relations

Any **Viewer or higher** can list a workspace's relations (paginate via
`continuationToken`). `relationType` in responses can be `Base`, `Branch`, or
`RelatedWorkspace`.

```bash
fab api "workspaces/${WORKSPACE_ID}/git/workspaceRelations"
```

### Delete a relation

Removes the lineage link only — it does **not** delete either workspace or its
items. The caller must be **Admin** on the workspace named in the path (either the
base or the branch side). Only a `Branch` relation is deletable — otherwise the API
returns `WorkspaceRelationTypeNotBranch`.

```bash
fab api -X delete "workspaces/${WORKSPACE_ID}/git/workspaceRelations/${RELATION_ID}"

## Related: cross-workspace item binding

Updating a target workspace from the same branch promotes items into it. Whether
each item-to-item reference rebinds automatically (logical IDs) or breaks (object
IDs / hardcoded endpoints) is a property of the item definition format, not of the
Git lifecycle, and applies equally to fabric-cicd and the Bulk Import API. To
predict a specific dependency's verdict, read the evidence-tagged compatibility
matrix, or empirically validate an uncertain reference, use the
**cross-workspace-item-binding** skill (a planned companion skill, not yet
available in this repo) — it is a distinct concern from the
connect/commit/update lifecycle this skill drives.

## Related: Terraform (infrastructure as code)

To manage the **connect** side declaratively (infrastructure as code) instead of
with imperative `fab api` calls, use the **git-integration-terraform** skill (a
planned companion skill, not yet available in this repo). It
covers the `microsoft/fabric` provider's `fabric_connection` and
`fabric_workspace_git` resources (Azure DevOps service principal or automatic,
GitHub PAT, init strategy, plan/apply/import). In that pattern Terraform owns the
connection, while the commit / update-from-git / status operations in this skill
remain the imperative runtime path — so a common setup is Terraform for the
connection plus a CLI step for update-from-git.

## Related: Variable Library (environment parameterization)

Git integration moves item *definitions* across workspaces, but it does not by
itself parameterize values that must differ per stage (dev/test/prod) — connection
strings, endpoints, capacity IDs, feature flags. That per-environment
parameterization is the job of a **Variable Library**: define the variables once,
provide a value set per stage, and have items resolve the stage-appropriate value.
When a Git-synced workspace needs values that vary by environment, use the
`variable-library-cli` companion skill for the variable/value-set
modeling instead of hardcoding or duplicating that logic here — this skill owns
the source-control lifecycle, the Variable Library skill owns the
parameterization it feeds.

## Gotchas, Rules, Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `400 WorkspaceHeadMismatch` | Stale `workspaceHead` | Re-read `git/status`, retry with the current head |
| `400 MissingWorkspaceConflictResolution` | Both sides changed the same item, but `updateFromGit` was sent without a `conflictResolution` | Add `conflictResolution` (policy `PreferRemote` or `PreferWorkspace`) + `options.allowOverrideItems: true`; check `git/status` for `conflictType: "Conflict"` first |
| `WorkspaceHasNoCapacityAssigned` | Workspace not on a capacity (Git needs one) | Assign a capacity to the workspace, then retry |
| `404 GitProviderResourceNotFound` on `git/connect` | The repo, branch, or `directoryName` does not exist on the provider — the API, unlike the portal, does **not** auto-create the folder | Verify the repo/branch names; if the **folder** is new, pre-create it by committing a `README.md` placeholder to the branch via the Git provider API (see [Connect a Workspace to Git](#connect-a-workspace-to-git)), then retry |
| `WorkspaceAlreadyConnectedToGit` | Workspace is already linked to a repo | Disconnect first, then connect to the new repo |
| `InsufficientPrivileges` / `403` | Caller lacks the role the operation needs (connect/disconnect need **Admin**; commit/update need at least **Contributor** with write on all items) | Grant the caller the required role: Admin to connect/disconnect, or Contributor with write on all items to commit/update |
| `PrincipalTypeNotSupported` | Service principal using automatic credentials (or GitHub) | Switch to a `ConfiguredConnection` in `myGitCredentials` |
| `commitToGitRequest is required` (with `fab api`) | Body piped via stdin | Write the body to a file, pass `-i body.json` |
| Operation returns `202` then nothing changes | Async not yet complete | Poll `operations/{id}` (from `--show_headers`), or poll `git/status` until heads match |
| Operation stuck in `Running` for a long time | Large workspace or a second Git op is queued | Keep polling with a sane timeout (about 10 min); never start a second Git op concurrently |
| `401 Unauthorized` | Wrong token audience | Run `fab auth login` (fab sets the audience automatically); on the `az rest` fallback pass `--resource https://api.fabric.microsoft.com` |
| `WorkspaceRelationRootDirectoryMismatch` on `git/workspaceRelations` | Base and branch workspaces are connected to different Git roots | Connect both to the SAME repo/org/project/directory (Azure DevOps) or repo URL/directory (GitHub), differing only by `branchName`, then retry |
| `WorkspaceRelationAlreadyExists` / `WorkspaceRelationBidirectionalExists` | The base↔branch relation is already recorded (it is bidirectional) | Nothing to do — `GET git/workspaceRelations` to confirm; do not also create the reverse direction |
| `WorkspaceRelationTypeNotBranch` on delete | Tried to delete a relation that is not a `Branch` relation | Only `Branch` relations are deletable — use the correct `workspaceRelationId` and delete from the branch side |
| Every sync reports an uncommitted change you did not make (one removed blank line, or a CRLF/LF flip) | In affected workspaces, an editor or AI agent authored the item source (`notebook-content.py`, `pipeline-content.json`, `.platform`) with a trailing final newline or CRLF, then Fabric re-serialized it to the observed export form (LF, **no** trailing newline) | Confirm the behavior with a representative round trip, then match the observed export at authoring time: no trailing newline, LF endings. Pin it in the synced repo with `.editorconfig` + `.gitattributes`, and tell your AI agent not to add a final newline.

## Examples

### Example 1: Commit source, then deploy into a target workspace

```bash
# Commit everything in the source workspace (jq builds a JSON-safe body)
SRC_HEAD=$(fab api "workspaces/${SRC_WS}/git/status" | jq -r '.text.workspaceHead')
jq -n --arg head "$SRC_HEAD" --arg msg "Deploy v1" \
  '{mode:"All", workspaceHead:$head, comment:$msg}' > commit.json
fab api -X post "workspaces/${SRC_WS}/git/commitToGit" -i commit.json
# ...poll src status until synced, then updateFromGit into ${TARGET_WS} (see above)
```

### Example 2: `az rest` fallback equivalents

When `fab` is unavailable, the same REST endpoints work through `az rest`. Always
pass `--resource`; a body can be inline (`--body '{...}'`) or from a file
(`--body @file.json`):

```bash
# status
az rest --method GET \
  --url "https://api.fabric.microsoft.com/v1/workspaces/${WORKSPACE_ID}/git/status" \
  --resource "https://api.fabric.microsoft.com"

# commit (body inline)
az rest --method POST \
  --url "https://api.fabric.microsoft.com/v1/workspaces/${WORKSPACE_ID}/git/commitToGit" \
  --resource "https://api.fabric.microsoft.com" \
  --headers "Content-Type=application/json" \
  --body "{\"mode\":\"All\",\"workspaceHead\":\"${HEAD}\",\"comment\":\"Author items\"}"
```
