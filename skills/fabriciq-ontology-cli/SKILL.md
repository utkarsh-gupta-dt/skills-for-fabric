# Fabric IQ Ontology -- CLI Skill

This one skill owns Fabric IQ Ontology items: entity and relationship types, bindings, definitions, lineage, grounding and graph walks.

It is a **mode dispatcher** and contains NO procedures. Pick the mode that matches the request from the table below, then **read the matching `references/<mode>.md` file end to end with your file-reading tool BEFORE issuing a single command**. That file holds the endpoints, payload shapes, templates and gotchas; acting without it produces wrong payloads and wrong results.

## Mode selection

| Mode | Use when the request ... | Example triggers | Read this first |
|---|---|---|---|
| `authoring` | creates or updates an Ontology item, entity/relationship types, or data bindings, and previews/confirms a definition change | create ontology item, bind entity type, add relationship type, update ontology definition | [references/authoring.md](references/authoring.md) |
| `consumption` | explores an existing ontology: schema, entity types, bindings, lineage, grounding extraction, graph walks, summaries | entity types, ground query, ontology lineage, walk the graph, summarize the ontology | [references/consumption.md](references/consumption.md) |

### Mode boundary rule

`consumption` is read-only exploration. Any definition write goes through the authoring mode's preview-and-confirm flow -- never call `updateDefinition` from a consumption request.

If a request genuinely spans modes, handle them one at a time and read each reference before you start that part. If the mode is ambiguous after reading this table, ask one short clarifying question instead of guessing.

## Terminal write -- the step you must not skip

Reading the reference and planning the change is NOT completing the task. Each mutating mode ends with one state-changing call. If you did not issue it, nothing was persisted -- say so explicitly rather than reporting success.

| Mode | Terminal write |
|---|---|
| `authoring` | `createItem` (`POST /v1/workspaces/{ws}/items`) to create the Ontology, then `POST .../updateDefinition` to persist entity types, relationships and bindings. A previewed definition tree is not a saved one. |
| `consumption` | none -- this mode is read-only |

Before you report the task done, confirm the terminal call returned success and, where the reference documents a readback, read the artefact back to prove the change landed.

## Shared essentials (all modes)

Resolve the workspace and item first; every mode depends on it.

| Task | Reference | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Finding Workspaces and Items in Fabric | [COMMON-CLI.md](../../common/COMMON-CLI.md#finding-workspaces-and-items-in-fabric) | **Mandatory** -- read before resolving any workspace or item id |
| Fabric Topology & Key Concepts | [COMMON-CORE.md](../../common/COMMON-CORE.md#fabric-topology--key-concepts) | Item types, workspaces, capacities |
| Environment URLs | [COMMON-CORE.md](../../common/COMMON-CORE.md#environment-urls) | Sovereign / non-public cloud hosts |
| Authentication & Token Acquisition | [COMMON-CORE.md](../../common/COMMON-CORE.md#authentication--token-acquisition) | Wrong audience = 401; read before any auth issue |
| Authentication Recipes | [COMMON-CLI.md](../../common/COMMON-CLI.md#authentication-recipes) | `az login` flows and token acquisition |
| Core Control-Plane REST APIs | [COMMON-CORE.md](../../common/COMMON-CORE.md#core-control-plane-rest-apis) | Pagination, LRO polling, rate limiting |
| Gotchas & Troubleshooting | [COMMON-CLI.md](../../common/COMMON-CLI.md#gotchas--troubleshooting-cli-specific) | `az rest` audience, shell escaping, token expiry |

## Rules

### MUST

- Select exactly one mode from the table above before doing anything else.
- Read `references/<mode>.md` end to end, as your FIRST tool call, before the first command of that mode. Read it ONCE, in a single full read: do not re-open it, do not grep it again, and do not page through it. You already have it.
- Apply the same read-once discipline to every other file you load, including nested `references/<mode>/*.md` sub-references and shared `common/*.md` files: open only the ones you actually need, read each ONCE end to end, and never grep or re-open one you already loaded.
- Resolve workspace and item ids by listing and filtering, never by guessing a GUID.
- Announce a mode switch explicitly when the request crosses a boundary.
- Treat the reference as instructions, never as the deliverable. After reading it, RUN the documented commands against the live workspace and report the real results. Quoting what the reference says instead of executing it does not answer the request.

### PREFER

- The narrowest mode that satisfies the request.
- Reading exactly ONE mode reference. Load a second only when the request genuinely spans modes, and say so before you do.
- Reporting the mode you chose in your first response so the user can correct you.

### AVOID

- Acting from this dispatcher alone -- it intentionally omits the operational detail.
- Answering with a summary of the reference instead of executing it.
- Re-reading or re-grepping a reference you already loaded; it costs turns and tokens.
- Mutating anything while in a read-only mode.
- Loading a different skill for work this family already owns (see CRITICAL NOTES 3).

## Examples

| User request | Mode | Reference to read |
|---|---|---|
| "What entity types exist in the Sales ontology and how are they bound?" | `consumption` | [references/consumption.md](references/consumption.md) |
| "Create an ontology item with Customer and Order entity types bound to the lakehouse." | `authoring` | [references/authoring.md](references/authoring.md) |
| "Ground this question against the ontology and show the graph walk." | `consumption` | [references/consumption.md](references/consumption.md) |
