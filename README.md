# Microsoft Fabric Skills

Microsoft Fabric Skills are reusable AI assistant instructions for working with Microsoft Fabric. They help GitHub Copilot CLI and compatible AI coding tools understand Fabric workloads, APIs, query patterns, and operational best practices.

## Install with GitHub Copilot CLI

Add the public marketplace:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add microsoft/skills-for-fabric
```

Install the main Fabric bundle. Power BI report authoring is packaged separately:

```bash
/plugin install fabric-skills@fabric-collection
```

Or install the Power BI authoring bundle:

```bash
# Power BI authoring: semantic models, Power BI report skills, and PBIP workflows
/plugin install powerbi-authoring@fabric-collection
```

Copilot CLI installs plugins as complete bundles. To limit installed skills, choose a focused bundle instead of filtering the full bundle.

> The persona bundles `fabric-authoring`, `fabric-consumption` and `fabric-operations` are retired. Every skill they carried ships in `fabric-skills`. The three ids still resolve as deprecated aliases of `fabric-skills`, so an existing install keeps working through `/plugin update`; new installs should use `fabric-skills`.

### Update installed plugins

Update one installed bundle:

```bash
/plugin update fabric-skills@fabric-collection
```

Replace `fabric-skills` with the focused bundle name to update that bundle. From a terminal, update every installed plugin with:

```bash
copilot plugin update --all
```

### Automatic update checking

Updates are handled by the agent host, not by a skill in this repository.

**GitHub Copilot CLI** -- opt in once by adding `autoUpdate` to the
`fabric-collection` entry in your own user settings
(`~/.copilot/settings.json`, or `%USERPROFILE%\.copilot\settings.json` on
Windows):

```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "fabric-collection": {
      "source": { "source": "github", "repo": "microsoft/skills-for-fabric" },
      "autoUpdate": true
    }
  }
}
```

Copilot CLI then refreshes the bundle at the start of every session in a trusted
working directory. This opt-in is honored only from your personal user settings
-- a repository or managed (MDM) setting cannot enable or redirect auto-update
for a marketplace. Auto-update is also skipped by default in CI. See the
[Copilot CLI plugin reference](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/reference/copilot-cli-reference/cli-plugin-reference).

**Claude Code** -- `fabric-collection` is a third-party marketplace, so enable
auto-update once: run `/plugin`, open **Marketplaces**, select
`fabric-collection`, and choose **Enable auto-update**. Administrators can
instead set `"autoUpdate": true` on its `extraKnownMarketplaces` entry in
managed settings.

**Cursor, Windsurf, and other hosts** -- re-run the host's plugin or marketplace
update command, or `git pull` a manual clone.

Every release bumps the `version` field in each plugin manifest, which lets
Copilot CLI and Claude Code detect a new release after auto-update is enabled.

## Install a single skill (APM)

Copilot plugin bundles install as a whole. To activate **one** skill instead of the
whole collection, use [APM](https://github.com/microsoft/apm) (Agent Package Manager).

Install the APM CLI:

```bash
# Windows (PowerShell)
irm https://aka.ms/apm-windows | iex

# macOS / Linux
curl -sSL https://aka.ms/apm-unix | sh

# or via pip
pip install apm-cli
```

Install a single skill into your project:

```bash
apm install microsoft/skills-for-fabric --skill sqldw-cli --target <tool>
```

Full documentation reference: [consumer guide](https://microsoft.github.io/apm/consumer/).

Useful flags:

| Flag | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `--skill NAME` | Install only the named skill instead of every skill in the package. Repeatable. |
| `--target`, `-t` | Tools to deploy to: `copilot`, `claude`, `cursor`, `codex`, etc. Comma-separated for several (`-t claude,cursor`). |
| `--global`, `-g` | Install to user scope (`~/.apm/`, `~/.agents/skills/`) instead of the current project. |
| `--only apm\|mcp` | Install only APM packages or only MCP servers. Both are installed by default, so `--only apm` deploys the skill without registering any MCP servers. |
| `--update` | Re-resolve dependencies to the latest version or Git ref allowed by `apm.yml` and rewrite `apm.lock.yaml`. |
| `--dry-run` | Print the install plan without writing anything. |
| `--verbose`, `-v` | Show per-file paths and full error context. |

The skill lands in `.agents/skills/<name>/`, its MCP servers are registered for
your target tool, and links into the shared reference material are rewritten to
the materialized copy under `apm_modules/`.

Notes:

- **Scope matters for Copilot.** The `copilot` target writes MCP state to VS Code's
  `.vscode/mcp.json` at project scope and to Copilot CLI's `~/.copilot/mcp-config.json`
  at global scope. If you use Copilot CLI and omit `-g`, the skill installs but its MCP
  servers never reach the CLI. Project and global are separate installs: a global one
  keeps its dependency state in `~/.apm/apm.yml`, not the project's. See the
  [APM MCP install docs](https://microsoft.github.io/apm/consumer/install-mcp-servers).
- Install the **repository**, then narrow with `--skill`. Installing a skill path
  directly leaves the shared reference links dangling, because APM only rewrites
  links that resolve inside the installed package root. `--skill` selects what is
  *activated*: APM materializes the whole package into
  `apm_modules/` and deploys only the skills you named.
- Valid `--skill` values are the folder names under `skills/` in the repository.
  Re-run with a different `--skill` to add more skills incrementally.
- APM adds `apm_modules/` to your `.gitignore`. It holds the shared material the
  installed skills link to, so keep it or re-run `apm install` after cloning.
- All Fabric MCP servers are registered on install, regardless of which skill you
  select. APM reads MCP dependencies only from the repository root manifest. That includes powerbi-modeling-mcp, a stdio server launched through npx. Use --only apm to deploy the skill without registering any MCP server.
- The Fabric agents are deployed alongside any `--skill` selection. APM always
  integrates the agents it discovers in the package, so a single-skill install
  still gets all five. They may reference skills you did not install; those
  references are inert until you add the skill.
- To drop one skill, edit the `skills:` list on that dependency in your `apm.yml`
  (`~/.apm/apm.yml` for a `-g` install) and re-run `apm install`. `apm uninstall`
  removes the whole package, not a single skill.

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for public release notes.

## Try an example prompt

- [Analytics PDF report](prompt_examples/NYC_AnalyzeExistingDataCreatePDF.txt)
- [Document my workspace](prompt_examples/DocumentMyWorkspace.txt)
- [NYC Taxi medallion architecture](prompt_examples/NYCTaxi_MedallionArchitecture.txt)
- [Dashboard app](prompt_examples/DashboardApp.txt)

After installing a bundle, open Copilot CLI in a project folder and ask for the Fabric task you want to perform, for example:

```text
Use Microsoft Fabric skills to design a medallion architecture for NYC taxi data.
```

## Authentication

Most Fabric operations require Azure authentication. Start with:

```bash
az login
az account get-access-token --resource https://api.fabric.microsoft.com
```

SQL, Spark, Power BI, and KQL workflows may require workload-specific endpoints or token audiences. The installed skills provide the detailed commands and API patterns for each workload.

## MCP servers

Skills provide guidance and patterns. MCP servers provide live tool access to data sources and APIs. Some bundles include MCP configuration where supported, and you can register additional Fabric MCP servers if your environment provides them.

See [MCP setup](mcp-setup/README.md).

When running Claude Code locally, the bundled remote Fabric MCPs reuse your existing Azure CLI sign-in.
The setup guide covers Codex configuration and older registrations that override the plugin.

## Other AI coding tools

GitHub Copilot CLI plugin installation is the recommended path. This repository also includes root-level configuration files for compatible AI coding tools — [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for Claude Code, [.cursorrules](.cursorrules) for Cursor, [.windsurfrules](.windsurfrules) for Windsurf, and [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for Codex / Jules / OpenCode. They are picked up automatically when the repo is cloned.

Gemini CLI also auto-discovers [GEMINI.md](GEMINI.md) when the repo is cloned.
