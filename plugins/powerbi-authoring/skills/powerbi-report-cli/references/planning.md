# powerbi-report-cli planning mode -- Power BI Report Planning

This skill orchestrates the full lifecycle for a new Power BI report:

**Define -> Inspect -> Spec -> Approve -> Build -> Validate -> Publish**

It is intentionally broader than a pure requirements-gathering flow: it captures
the report spec **and** continues into implementation after the user approves.

## Must/Prefer/Avoid

### MUST

- Use this skill for broad report creation workflows that need requirements, dependency checks, approval, and build sequencing.
- Ask focused clarification questions one at a time and stop after the required decision is clear.
- Lock `_brief/report-spec.md` and get approval before implementation.
- Route design decisions through the `design` mode and file mechanics through
  the `authoring` mode. For the sufficient-input locked-spec fast path, consult
  only the focused canonical design-contract references and use conservative
  defaults instead of loading the broad design workflow.

### PREFER

- Infer obvious answers from the prompt, model, existing PBIP files, or earlier rounds instead of re-asking.
- Inspect the semantic model before finalizing page scope or visual recommendations.
- Treat publishing as optional and only proceed when approved.

### AVOID

- Do not use this skill for small, surgical edits to existing PBIR files.
- Do not build before the user approves the locked report spec.
- Do not duplicate detailed visual-design or PBIR-authoring guidance that belongs to companion skills.

## Examples of When to Use

Use this skill when the user wants to create a new Power BI report and needs
both:

1. A guided requirements workflow.
2. A path to implementation after approval.

Examples:

- "Let's create a new Power BI report from this semantic model."
- "Help me define and then build a Power BI report."
- "Use the report playbook to start a new report."
- "Create a reusable workflow for new Power BI reports."

Do **not** use this skill for a small edit to an existing report page. For
direct PBIR authoring tasks, use the `authoring` mode. For visual critique or
greenfield design guidance **without the full guided workflow** (a one-off
"redesign this" or "what should this look like?"), use
the `design` mode directly. This skill *uses* the design skill during
Rounds 3–4 — it does not replace it.

## Required Operating Rules

1. **Ask one question at a time.** Use `ask_user` for each clarification.
2. **Run 3-5 clarification rounds maximum.** Each round may have one primary
   question and, only if absolutely necessary, one follow-up.
3. **Establish the semantic-model inventory before locking the spec.** If the
   user supplies enough tables, columns, measures, and relationship context to
   bind every requested visual, treat that supplied schema as the inventory for
   a locked-spec-only request; a single-table schema needs no relationship
   discovery. Do not inspect an unrelated local PBIP/TMDL project merely because
   one exists. Otherwise use the semantic model skill or an MCP server when
   available, then fall back to local TMDL/PBIP files.
4. **Check dependencies explicitly.** Do not assume Desktop, MCP, authoring, or
   Fabric publishing are available.
5. **Produce one locked `_brief/report-spec.md` before building.**
6. **Ask for approval before implementation.** If a new-report request also
   says build or publish, treat that as post-approval scope: persist the locked
   spec, ask for approval, and stop. Do not load authoring/management, create
   implementation files, or call Fabric write APIs until a later user reply
   explicitly approves the spec.
7. **When approved, build end-to-end.** Model changes, PBIR generation,
   validation, Desktop preview, screenshot loop, and optional Fabric publish.
8. **Local edits stay local unless publishing is approved.**
9. **Do not re-ask known answers.** If the original prompt, inspected files, or
   a prior round already provides audience, page count, delivery target, scope,
   or design direction, capture it in working notes and move on. Ask only for
   genuine ambiguity or risky tradeoffs.

## Dependency Checklist

Before implementation, capture this status:

| Dependency | Purpose | Required When |
|---|---|---|
| Power BI Desktop | Open/reload PBIP and visually validate report | Always for local preview |
| PBIP/PBIR project | File-based report authoring | Always for generated reports |
| TMDL semantic model | Model persistence and source control | Required for model edits |
| powerbi-modeling-mcp | Inspect tables, columns, measures; create measures/columns; deploy semantic model | Required only for the **`Live Connected Model`** entry mode (remote Fabric model) — not needed for **`Local Model`** mode |
| the `authoring` mode | Validate PBIR, reload Desktop, screenshot pages | Required for report authoring validation |
| the `management` mode | Create/update/download Fabric reports | Required only for Fabric publishing |
| Node.js | Generator-based PBIR authoring | Recommended for reproducible reports |

If a dependency is unavailable, continue planning and mark the affected phase as
blocked/manual. Do not pretend it is available.

## Round Structure

### Round 0 — Setup and Dependency Check

Goal: identify the semantic model, report target, and available tooling.

#### Entry modes — how the user is starting

A report always sits on top of a semantic model, so the first job is to locate
that model. There are multiple entry modes; detect which one the user is starting
from and follow the matching path. All three converge on the same working-notes
block below.

| Entry mode | The user is starting from |
|------------|---------------------------|
| `Local Model` | Model files already on disk (`.pbip` / `.SemanticModel` / `.Report`) |
| `Live Connected Model` | A model that lives in a Fabric/Power BI workspace (link, ID, or name) |
| `No Model` | No model anywhere — only raw data or an idea |

If the prompt doesn't make the starting point obvious, ask one question to decide
which mode applies — but only when it can't be inferred or inspected:

> What semantic model or dataset should this report use?

A local-folder answer is `Local Model`, a Fabric model/workspace reference is
`Live Connected Model`, and "no model yet" is `No Model`.

**`Local Model`.** The user already has a `.pbip` / `.SemanticModel` /
`.Report` folder on disk.

- Enumerate local `.SemanticModel` and `.pbip` folders in scope and confirm
  which one to use. This is the default path.

**`Live Connected Model`.** The user points at an
existing semantic model in a Fabric/Power BI workspace by any means. All forms
funnel into one resolution procedure that ends with the **canonical identifier
tuple** — `{ workspaceName, workspaceId, modelName, modelId }` — which is what
both report binding and live model inspection consume.

*Step 1 — Detect the input shape and extract what you can:*

- **Portal URL** (shape varies). Parse GUIDs out of the path: `workspaceId` =
  the segment after `/groups/`, `modelId` = the segment after `/datasets/` or
  `/modeling/`. Ignore the tenant subdomain (`app.`, `msit.`, …). `/groups/me`
  means *My workspace*. Example `modelView` link — both values are **GUIDs**:
  `https://<tenant>.powerbi.com/groups/<workspace-id>/modeling/<model-id>/modelView?...`.
- **GUID or name with the kind clear from context** — the user or a URL says it
  is a *model* vs a *workspace* (e.g. "the *evSales* model in the *Sales*
  workspace") → assign to `modelId`/`modelName` or `workspaceId`/`workspaceName`
  accordingly.
- **Kind unspecified** — a bare GUID or name with no indication whether it refers
  to a model or a workspace → **ask the user which it is** before resolving; do
  not assume.
- **A piece is missing** — once the kind is known, ask the user for anything the
  resolution still needs (e.g. a model reference with no workspace).

*Step 2 — Resolve to the full tuple.* This skill does **not** own connection
mechanics — prefer handing the reference to the modeling capability (the Power BI
modeling MCP `powerbi-modeling-mcp` / `semantic-model-authoring` skill) to
resolve and connect. Note the live connect needs the workspace and model
**names**, so if you only have a GUID or URL you must resolve names first. To do
that, use the read-only Fabric workspace/item lookups in
`COMMON-CLI.md § Finding Workspaces and Items` (see `../../../common/COMMON-CLI.md`, section `finding-workspaces-and-items-in-fabric`),
including the **reverse** (ID → name) direction:

- `workspaceId → workspaceName`: get the workspace by ID and read `displayName`.
- `modelId → modelName` (or `modelName → modelId`): list `SemanticModel` items
  in the workspace and match on `id`/`displayName`.
- **Bare `modelId`, no workspace**: the model GUID alone cannot be located
  without a workspace — search accessible workspaces' semantic models for the
  id, or ask the user which workspace it lives in.

*Step 3 — Disambiguate lookup results.* After resolving, if a name or GUID
matches **zero** items (not found or no access) or **more than one** (e.g. a
common name that recurs across workspaces), **ask the user** to pick the intended
workspace/model before continuing. Never guess silently.

*Then:*

- If no live model-inspection capability (modeling MCP) is connected, this mode
  cannot proceed: tell the user the reference requires the modeling MCP and
  either connect it or fall back to `Local Model` mode with local files.
- Model inspection happens in Round 2 against the live model — no local TMDL is
  required.
- **Persist the binding:** record the resolved tuple (`workspaceName`,
  `workspaceId`, `modelName`, `modelId`) and the assembled `connectionString` in
  the brief's **Semantic model binding** section so later steps can reuse it
  without re-resolving.
- **Bind the report:** hand the resolved `workspaceName`, `modelName`, and
  `modelId` to the `authoring` mode, which authors `definition.pbir` using
  the live `byConnection` form. Do not author the connection string here.

**`No Model`.** The user has only raw data or an idea and no model
anywhere. This is **out of scope for report planning** — model creation belongs
to the `semantic-model-authoring` skill and the modeling MCP. Do not attempt to
build a model here. Recognize the situation, point the user to
`semantic-model-authoring` to create the model first, and resume report planning
once a model exists (then re-enter via `Local Model` or `Live Connected Model`).

Once the model is identified, inspect/check the remaining tooling:

- Existing `.pbip`, `.Report`, `.SemanticModel` folders.
- Whether TMDL files exist.
- Whether Power BI Desktop preview automation via `powerbi-report-author preview --host desktop` is available.
- Whether the modeling MCP (`powerbi-modeling-mcp`) connection is available or can be established.
- Whether Fabric publishing is requested.

### Round 1 — Audience and Job

Goal: understand who the report is for and what decision/job it supports.

If both audience and job-to-be-done are already clear from the prompt, summarize
the inferred answer instead of asking. Otherwise ask for the missing piece(s),
one at a time.

Ask when audience is unclear:

> Who is this report primarily for?

Recommended choices:

1. Executives / leadership — concise KPIs, trends, risks, decisions
2. Analysts — exploration, drilldowns, comparisons, tables
3. Operators — monitoring, exceptions, status, action queues
4. External audience — polished story, guided narrative, minimal slicers
5. Enthusiasts / fans — magazine-style narrative, rich visuals, rankings

Then ask only if the job-to-be-done is still unclear:

> What should the report help them do?

Recommended choices:

1. Understand the overall story
2. Track performance
3. Find outliers or opportunities
4. Compare entities or segments
5. Explore individual records/profiles
6. Prepare for a recurring business review

Capture:

```markdown
Audience:
Primary purpose:
Tone:
Success criteria:
```

### Round 2 — Model Inventory and Scope

Goal: inspect the model and define the first-build scope boundary without
re-asking for scope the user already gave.

If the prompt already provides enough schema detail to bind every requested
visual, record that supplied schema as the model inventory and continue. For a
locked-spec-only request, do not enumerate the current directory, inspect a
different local PBIP/TMDL project, connect to a live model, or reload broad
design references solely to reconfirm facts the user supplied.

Otherwise, use whatever model-inspection capability is available — pick the
first that applies, in order of preference:

1. A semantic-model authoring skill, if installed.
2. A modeling MCP server (e.g., `powerbi-modeling-mcp-*`) — connect to the
   live model, list tables/columns/measures/relationships, and run DAX for
   live validation.
3. Direct reads of local TMDL files (`definition/model.tmdl`,
   `definition/tables/*.tmdl`, `definition/relationships.tmdl`) when no live
   connection is available.

Do not hardcode tool names in user-facing prompts — describe the inspection
intent and let the agent pick the available tool.

Summarize:

```markdown
Facts:
- table, grain, keys, useful measures

Dimensions:
- date/time, geography, entity, category, owner, status, segment

Existing measures:
- core available measures

Likely missing model work:
- measures
- calculated columns
- relationship fixes
- sort columns
- helper fields for slicers/search

Risks:
- nulls/sparsity
- inactive relationships
- high-cardinality slicers
- fields that will not filter as expected
```

After inspection, infer the first-build scope from the original request and
prior answers. Do not ask a standalone scope question if the user already gave a
page count, report type, or content boundary (for example, "build a 4 page
dashboard"). Instead, summarize the boundary in working notes:

```markdown
First-build scope:
- <focused first build / standard report / operational app / narrative report>
- inferred from: <user prompt | prior answer | model shape>
- included now:
- deferred:
```

Ask a scope question only when the boundary is unclear, too broad, or risky. If
asking, present tailored choices from the inspected model rather than generic
first-build options. Example:

> The model supports sales, products, geography, discounts, and profitability.
> For this first build, should we keep it focused on executive performance, or
> include a deeper product/customer exploration too?

### Round 3 — Narrative and Page Plan

Goal: turn the model and scope into page architecture.

For the sufficient-input locked-spec fast path, preserve the page plan and
visual intent already supplied, consult only the focused canonical
`design/design-brief.md` contract (and its continuation when needed), and choose
conservative composition defaults without reopening broad design guidance or
asking the user to choose a report shape. Otherwise, invoke or explicitly
consult the `design` mode for page-level archetype routing and composition
guidance. The design skill owns visual routing; do not duplicate its routing
table here. Use the data shape from Round 2 to surface 2-3 report shape options
for user sign-off.

The five archetypes the design skill ships are: **Executive Summary**,
**Operational Monitor**, **Analytical Canvas**, **Narrative Story**,
**Comparative Benchmark**. Use the design skill's archetype and composition
guidance for layout variants, multi-archetype reports, and cross-page variant
rotation.

Ask only after applying the inferred first-build scope from Round 2:

> Which report shape should we use?

Present 2–3 named compositions (e.g., *Executive landing + Analytical
exploration + Comparative ranking* for a multi-domain ask, or *Single
executive landing* for a focused ask). Recommend one based on Rounds 1–2
and mark it `(Recommended)`.

Draft page list in the answer after the user chooses:

```markdown
Proposed pages:
1. <Page> — archetype — purpose — core visuals — fields/measures
2. <Page> — archetype — purpose — core visuals — fields/measures
<repeat for each approved page>
```

Capture slicers and interactions:

- Global slicers
- Page-specific slicers
- Search/prefix slicers for high-cardinality dimensions
- Drillthrough/profile pages
- Navigation model: page navigator vs. custom buttons vs. bookmark navigator (pick one primary)
- Button actions needed: Back, page navigation, bookmark, drillthrough, apply/clear all slicers, Web URL, Q&A
- Bookmarks: named saved states for narrative steps or view toggles

### Round 4 — Design Identity, Accessibility, and Delivery

Goal: lock the design identity, accessibility baseline, and delivery target.

For the sufficient-input locked-spec fast path, use a conservative accessible
identity, record it explicitly in the canonical contract, and defer optional
stylistic variation to approval; do not load tone or archetype catalogs solely
to choose among defaults. Otherwise, invoke or explicitly consult the `design`
mode for design identity and theme direction. Design identity (tone +
signature) is owned by the design skill — do not invent a parallel vocabulary
here. Use the design skill's identity guidance to pick a tone+signature
combination, then surface it to the user.

Ask:

> What should this report feel like?

Present 2–3 concrete identity options adapted to the audience and domain from
Rounds 1–2. Each option names a report feel and the one signature visual move
it implies. Recommend one and mark it `(Recommended)`.

If the user has brand guidelines, make one option brand-forward rather than
picking a generic tone.

Then ask delivery only if unclear:

> Where should the finished report end up?

Recommended choices:

1. Local PBIP only first
2. Publish to an existing Fabric workspace
3. Create new semantic model + report in Fabric
4. Update an existing Fabric report
5. Build local first, decide publishing later

Design defaults (these come from the design skill's gotchas + base theme;
applied automatically unless the user overrides):

- Use accessible contrast (WCAG AA minimum on every text/background pair).
- Avoid red-on-red and low-contrast palettes.
- Prefer Azure Map over deprecated map/filledMap visuals.
- Add alt text to every chart.
- Use searchable dropdown slicers for high-cardinality fields.
- Use tile/list slicers only for short categorical fields.
- Place detailed tables near the bottom of the page.
- Keep report interactions predictable and consistent.
