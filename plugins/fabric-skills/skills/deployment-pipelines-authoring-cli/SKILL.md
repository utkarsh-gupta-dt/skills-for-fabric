# Fabric Deployment Pipelines Authoring — CLI Skill

Automates Fabric Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) with **deployment pipelines**: promote Fabric
content between stages (typically Development → Test → Production) using the Fabric core control-plane
REST API. This skill covers pipeline/stage lifecycle, workspace assignment, and stage-to-stage deployment
(a long-running operation).

## Prerequisite Knowledge

Read these companion documents first — this skill assumes their patterns and does **not** repeat them:

This skill adds: **how to drive the deployment-pipelines REST surface** from an agentic terminal.

## Concepts

- A **deployment pipeline** contains **2–10 ordered stages** (`order` starts at 0). Each stage may have at
  most **one assigned workspace**, and a workspace can be assigned to at most one stage.
- **Deployment** copies supported item content from a **source stage** to an **adjacent target stage**.
  Forward deploys (dev→test→prod) work between any adjacent stages. **Backward** deploys (e.g. prod→test)
  are currently supported **only when the target stage is empty** (no assigned workspace) — you cannot
  backward-deploy over a stage that already has a workspace.
- **Item pairing (autobinding).** During deployment Fabric records a **connection between a source item and
  its clone** in the target stage; this pairing is how later deploys know which target item to overwrite,
  and how related items (e.g. a report and its semantic model) stay bound. There is **no REST API to _set_
  pairing** — it is maintained automatically — but you can **observe** the current pairing via the
  `sourceItemId` / `targetItemId` fields returned by `List stage items`. See the *Fix a broken item pairing*
  workflow below for the only supported repair.
- Deploy is an **asynchronous long-running operation (LRO)**: the API returns `202 Accepted` with an
  operation ID; you poll for completion.
- **Deployment rules** and **parameter rules** (e.g. repoint a data source per stage) are configured in the
  Fabric **portal UI** — there is **no REST API to create rules**. Do not claim otherwise.
- Only **supported item types** are copied by a deploy; unsupported items are skipped (not an error). The
  supported set changes over time — see [references/supported-item-types.md](references/supported-item-types.md).
- There is **no "what changed" / compare REST API**. `List stage items` returns item **identity + pairing**
  (`itemId`, `itemDisplayName`, `itemType`, `sourceItemId`, `targetItemId`, `lastDeploymentTime`) — but **no
  change status**, and `lastDeploymentTime` is the last **deployment** time, **not** the last edit time, so
  it is not a reliable change signal. To deploy only changed items you must **diff the two stages yourself**
  and build the `items` list (see the *Deploy only changed items* workflow below). The portal's "Compare"
  view is server-side and not exposed via API.

## Must/Prefer/Avoid

### MUST DO
- Resolve pipeline, stage, and workspace **IDs by name** via list + JMESPath before any mutating call. Never fabricate GUIDs.
- Target the correct base URL: `https://api.fabric.microsoft.com/v1/deploymentPipelines` and acquire a token for the `https://api.fabric.microsoft.com` audience.
- Treat **Deploy Stage Content** as an LRO: on `202`, capture the operation ID and poll `/v1/operations/{operationId}` until the state is `Succeeded`/`Failed`, then surface the result.
- When the **target stage has no assigned workspace**, include `createdWorkspaceDetails` (name, and `capacityId` when needed) in the deploy body, or the deploy fails.
- Confirm destructive intent (delete pipeline, unassign workspace, backward deploy over prod) with the user before executing.
- Verify the caller has the **required permissions** before a mutating call (see *Required permissions* below): pipeline **Admin** for every pipeline operation, plus the appropriate **workspace** role for assign/deploy. Surface a clear, actionable message on `401`/`403` rather than retrying blindly.

### PREFER
- Selective deploys via the `items` array (`{ sourceItemId, itemType }`) when the user names specific items; omit `items` to deploy **all** supported items.
- A human-readable `note` on every deploy — but know it is **write-only**: the API accepts it and never
  returns it (it appears only in the portal UI). For a programmatic audit trail, also record the deploy
  externally (CI/CD logs or a Git commit message).
- `List Deployment Pipeline Stage Items` to preview what will move before deploying.
- Idempotent scripting: check whether a pipeline/stage/assignment already exists before creating it.

### AVOID
- Inventing a "create deployment rule" or "parameter rule" REST call — those are UI-only today.
- Assigning a workspace during an **active deployment** (the assign call fails) or to a stage/workspace that is already paired.
- Hardcoding `api.fabric.microsoft.com` in sovereign clouds — resolve the host from environment config.
- Using a service principal without first confirming the Fabric admin enabled SP creation of deployment pipelines.
- **Hashing raw `getDefinition` output to detect changes without normalizing.** Deployment **auto-rebinds**
  embedded references in the target (pipeline `notebookId`/`workspaceId`, report→model id, Direct Lake
  server/db), so a paired target's definition legitimately differs from the source even when nothing was
  edited — naive hashing reports **false "changed"**. Strip/normalize those binding fields before comparing.
- **Diffing by dumping every item definition into the agent's context.** A full two-stage content diff can be
  dozens of `getDefinition` calls and >100 KB — do the compare in a script
  ([references/scripts/diff_item_definitions.py](references/scripts/diff_item_definitions.py)) and surface only
  the resulting change list, and for a changed item forward **only the emitted diff**, never the two full
  definitions, to the model.
- Unassigning a workspace to repair a broken pairing **without first warning the user** that unassign
  **permanently deletes that stage's deployment history and its configured deployment/parameter rules** —
  always ask whether the stage has rules before unassigning (see *Fix a broken item pairing*).

## REST API Reference

Base: `https://api.fabric.microsoft.com/v1`. Delegated scopes are **per operation** — provision a service
principal with least privilege:

| Operation | Required delegated scope |
|---|---|
| List / Get (pipelines, stages, stage items, operations) | `Pipeline.Read.All` **or** `Pipeline.ReadWrite.All` |
| Create / Update / Delete pipeline, Update stage | `Pipeline.ReadWrite.All` |
| Assign / Unassign workspace | `Pipeline.ReadWrite.All` **and** `Workspace.ReadWrite.All` |
| **Deploy stage content** | **`Pipeline.Deploy`** |

Deploy uses its own `Pipeline.Deploy` scope — an app scoped only to `Pipeline.ReadWrite.All` gets a **403**
on `POST .../deploy`.

| Operation | Method + Path |
|---|---|
| List pipelines | `GET /deploymentPipelines` |
| Create pipeline | `POST /deploymentPipelines` |
| Get / Update / Delete pipeline | `GET|PATCH|DELETE /deploymentPipelines/{id}` |
| List / Get stages | `GET /deploymentPipelines/{id}/stages[/{stageId}]` |
| Update stage | `PATCH /deploymentPipelines/{id}/stages/{stageId}` |
| List stage items | `GET /deploymentPipelines/{id}/stages/{stageId}/items` |
| Assign workspace to stage | `POST /deploymentPipelines/{id}/stages/{stageId}/assignWorkspace` |
| Unassign workspace from stage | `POST /deploymentPipelines/{id}/stages/{stageId}/unassignWorkspace` |
| **Deploy stage content (LRO)** | `POST /deploymentPipelines/{id}/deploy` |
| List operations (≤20 recent) | `GET /deploymentPipelines/{id}/operations` |
| Get operation (with execution plan) | `GET /deploymentPipelines/{id}/operations/{operationId}` |
| Role assignments | `GET|POST|DELETE /deploymentPipelines/{id}/roleAssignments[/{principalId}]` |

### Request-body shapes (guidance)

- **Create**: `{ "displayName", "description"?, "stages": [ { "displayName", "description"?, "isPublic" } ] }` — 2–10 stages.
- **Assign workspace**: `{ "workspaceId" }`.
- **Deploy**: `{ "sourceStageId", "targetStageId", "items"?: [ { "sourceItemId", "itemType" } ], "note"?, "options"?: { "allowCrossRegionDeployment": false }, "createdWorkspaceDetails"?: { "name", "capacityId"? } }`.

## Required permissions

Deployment pipeline operations are governed by **two** independent permission systems: your role on the
**pipeline** (its own `roleAssignments`) and your role on each **workspace** involved. You generally need
**both**. Deployment pipelines require a Fabric capacity/subscription, and the pipeline creator becomes the
pipeline **Admin**.

| Operation | Pipeline role | Workspace role(s) |
|---|---|---|
| Create a pipeline | — (becomes **Admin** on create) | **Admin** of a Fabric workspace (feature access prerequisite) |
| Get / list pipeline, stages, items, operations | **Admin** (shared access) | — |
| Update / delete pipeline; manage `roleAssignments` | **Admin** | — |
| **Assign / unassign** a workspace to a stage | **Admin** | **Admin** of the workspace being (un)assigned |
| **Deploy** stage content | **Admin** | at least **Contributor/Member** on **both** the source and target stage workspaces (higher role if the target items require it) |
| Deploy to an **empty** target stage (creates a workspace) | **Admin** | capacity-assignment permission to place the new workspace on a capacity; the deploying user becomes the **only Admin** of the newly created workspace and owner of cloned semantic models |

Notes:
- Sharing a pipeline grants the pipeline **Admin** role — there is no lower "viewer-only" pipeline write role for these operations.
- A **service principal** can drive these APIs only if the Fabric admin enabled *service principals can create deployment pipelines* (and the SP holds the same pipeline + workspace roles above).
- On `403`, distinguish *missing pipeline role* from *missing workspace role* in the message so the user knows which access to request.



**Create a pipeline** → POST the display name + ordered stages; capture the returned stage IDs (they are
what you deploy between).

**Assign a workspace to a stage** → resolve stage ID and workspace ID by name, verify both are unassigned,
then POST `assignWorkspace`. Requires admin on both the pipeline and the workspace.

**Deploy content** → resolve source/target stage IDs, optionally preview stage items, POST `deploy` (all
items or a selected `items` list) with a `note`, then poll the returned operation to completion and report
which items moved.

**Deploy only changed items** → there is no diff/compare API, so compute the delta yourself. `List stage
items` gives identity + pairing only (no timestamps, no change status), so change detection means comparing
**item definitions**:
1. Resolve the source and target **stage** IDs and the workspace assigned to each.
2. List items in **both** stages (`GET .../stages/{stageId}/items`) — each source row carries `sourceItemId`
   (as `itemId`) and its paired `targetItemId` (absent = **new/unpaired**). Also list the target stage to find
   **deleted** items (present in target, not paired from any source). Pair by `targetItemId`; fall back to
   `(itemType, displayName)` only when no pipeline pairing exists (name-matching can't detect renames).
3. **Filter out system-managed children** — a `SQLEndpoint` is auto-created per Lakehouse/Warehouse and should
   not be diffed or deployed on its own; it follows its parent.
4. Classify each paired item:
   - **New** (no `targetItemId`) → deploy.
   - **Changed** → detect via `POST .../items/{id}/getDefinition` on **both** stages, then diff. Run
     [references/scripts/diff_item_definitions.py](references/scripts/diff_item_definitions.py) on the two
     responses: it decodes each part, **normalizes** the auto-rebound fields (pipeline `notebookId`/
     `workspaceId`, report model id, Direct Lake server/db) for you, and prints only the differing parts
     (exit `1` = changed, `0` = identical) — so you don't hand-roll hashing or false-positive on unedited
     items. Note the `getDefinition` contract differs by type:
     `Notebook`/`SemanticModel`/`Report` are **LRO** (`202` → poll → `GET .../result`);
     `DataPipeline` returns **`200` synchronously**.
   - Types **without a usable `getDefinition` diff**: `Warehouse` has **no** item-definition API, and
     `Lakehouse` / `Environment` *do* expose `getDefinition` but their definitions capture structure/metadata
     only (not table data or most content edits) — so for all three, diff by **presence** and treat as changed
     only when new or when the user indicates content changed.
   - When you cannot prove equality, treat the item as **changed** (safe default).
5. Do the comparison **in a script** (parallelize the independent `getDefinition` calls; they dominate
   latency) and surface only the computed change list. To let the model reason about *what* changed in an
   item, forward **only the emitted diff** (`diff_item_definitions.py` output), not the two full definitions —
   a normalized diff is typically a few lines versus the >100 KB of raw payloads.
6. Filter to **supported item types** (see references), show the user the change list, confirm, then POST a
   **selective** `deploy` with the `{ sourceItemId, itemType }` array and a `note`, and poll to completion.

> Deletions do **not** propagate via a selective `items` deploy — an item removed from the source stage is not
> removed from the target by a selective deploy. Use a **full** deploy (omit `items`) to propagate deletions,
> or delete the target item manually, and warn the user of this before promoting.

**Fix a broken item pairing** → pairing (the source↔target connection Fabric maintains, a.k.a. autobinding)
is **not settable via any REST API**. When two items that should be paired across stages are not — surfaced
by a deploy that duplicates an item instead of overwriting it, an autobind/dependency failure, or the user
reporting it — the **only supported repair is to unassign the affected stage's workspace and re-assign it**,
which forces Fabric to rebuild the pairing on the next deploy. This is destructive:
1. **Warn the user first.** Unassigning a workspace **permanently deletes that stage's deployment history and
   all its configured deployment/parameter rules** — they cannot be recovered by re-assigning.
2. **Ask whether the stage has rules.** Because rules are UI-only (no REST API to read or recreate them),
   explicitly ask the user whether the stage has deployment/parameter rules configured **before** unassigning.
   If it does, have them record the rules (or recreate them in the portal afterward) and get explicit
   confirmation to proceed.
3. Only after confirmation, `POST .../stages/{stageId}/unassignWorkspace`, then
   `POST .../stages/{stageId}/assignWorkspace` with the same `workspaceId`, and re-run the deploy so the
   pairing is re-established.

**Track / audit** → `List operations` for recent history; `Get operation` to inspect the execution plan and
per-item status of a specific deployment.

### Deploy operational caveats & common errors

- **One deploy per pipeline at a time.** A pipeline runs a single operation at a time; starting another while
  one is in flight fails with **`WorkspaceMigrationOperationInProgress` (HTTP 400)**. Always poll the current
  operation to a terminal state before starting the next stage promotion (this is also why the *assign*
  workspace call fails during an active deployment).
- **First deploy after assigning a workspace can fail with `Alm_InvalidRequest_WorkloadUnavailable`.** Newly
  assigned workspaces need **~60–120 s** for workload services (Lakehouse, Notebook, etc.) to initialize.
  Mitigate by waiting before the first deploy, or deploy Power BI items (`SemanticModel`, `Report`) first and
  Fabric-native items (`Lakehouse`, `Notebook`) after a short delay; retry on this error. Subsequent deploys
  are reliable once workloads are warm.
- **The operation ID is returned in the `x-ms-operation-id` response header** (alongside `Location`), not the
  `202` body. `az rest` does not surface response headers cleanly — for reliable header capture in automation,
  issue the deploy with `curl -i` (or Python `requests`) and parse the header, then poll
  `/v1/operations/{operationId}` with `az rest`.
- **Deploy copies definitions, not data.** Only item metadata/definitions are promoted; table data, query
  results, and caches are not. Trigger refreshes/loads in the target stage after a deploy.
- **Maximum 300 items per deploy request.** A selective (or full) deploy is capped at **300 deployed items**;
  batch larger promotions across multiple deploy calls.

## Examples

### Create a three-stage pipeline
Deployment-pipeline `displayName` is **unique tenant-wide** — a create for a name
already in use fails with `Alm_InvalidRequest_DuplicateAlmPipelineName` (HTTP 400,
"pipeline name ... is already in use"). To make a create re-runnable, drop any
existing pipeline of that name first, then create. Write the JSON body to a file
and pass it with `--body @file.json` — an inline multi-line `--body '{...}'` is
mangled into an empty body on Windows/PowerShell (`az` is `az.cmd`), which the API
rejects with `InvalidInput: Unexpected end when reading JSON`.
```bash
# Idempotent: delete an existing "Sales Analytics ALM" if present, then create.
EXISTING=$(az rest --method GET --resource https://api.fabric.microsoft.com \
  --url "https://api.fabric.microsoft.com/v1/deploymentPipelines" \

### Assign a workspace to the Development stage
```bash

### Deploy all items dev → test and wait for the LRO
```bash
# Kick off the deployment (returns 202 + an operation id header).

# Then poll /v1/operations/{operationId} until state is Succeeded or Failed
# (see COMMON-CLI § Long-Running Operations pattern).
```

### Deploy only selected items
```bash
az rest --method POST \

### Deploy only the items that changed (compute the diff first)
```bash
# 1. List paired items for BOTH stages. Each source row carries itemId (= sourceItemId)
#    and its paired targetItemId (absent = new/unpaired). There is NO timestamp or
#    change-status field, so "changed" must be detected from item definitions.
az rest --method GET --resource https://api.fabric.microsoft.com \
  --url "https://api.fabric.microsoft.com/v1/deploymentPipelines/$PIPELINE_ID/stages/$SOURCE_STAGE_ID/items" \

# 2. NEW items = unpaired (no targetItemId). Exclude system-managed SQLEndpoint children.
NEW=$(jq '[.value[]
  | select(.itemType != "SQLEndpoint")
  | select(has("targetItemId") | not)
  | { sourceItemId: .itemId, itemType: .itemType }]' source-items.json)

# 3. CHANGED items (paired): fetch getDefinition from BOTH stages, then diff with
#    references/scripts/diff_item_definitions.py. It decodes each part, NORMALIZES the
#    auto-rebound fields (notebookId/workspaceId in pipelines, model id in reports,
#    server/db in Direct Lake models) and prints ONLY the differing parts. Notebook/
#    SemanticModel/Report are LRO (202 -> poll -> /result); DataPipeline returns 200 sync.
#    Parallelize the independent getDefinition calls. Per paired definition-backed item:
#      getDefinition SOURCE_WS id            > src.json
#      getDefinition TARGET_WS targetItemId  > tgt.json
#      python references/scripts/diff_item_definitions.py src.json tgt.json > diff.json
#      # exit 1 = changed -> add { sourceItemId, itemType } to $ITEMS; exit 0 = unchanged.
#      # Forward diff.json (NOT src.json/tgt.json) to the model to explain the change.
#    Merge NEW + CHANGED into $ITEMS. When equality can't be proven, include the item.

# 4. Selective deploy of just the changed set.
az rest --method POST --resource https://api.fabric.microsoft.com \
  --url "https://api.fabric.microsoft.com/v1/deploymentPipelines/$PIPELINE_ID/deploy" \
  --headers "Content-Type=application/json" \
  --body "$(jq -n --arg s "$SOURCE_STAGE_ID" --arg t "$TARGET_STAGE_ID" --argjson items "$ITEMS" \
    '{ sourceStageId: $s, targetStageId: $t, items: $items, note: "Deploy only changed items" }')"
# Then poll /v1/operations/{operationId} until terminal.
# NOTE: a selective deploy does NOT propagate deletions — use a full deploy (omit items) for those.
```

### Prompt/response

**User:** "Promote my Sales dev workspace to the Test stage and tell me when it's done."

**Assistant (behavior):**
1. Lists deployment pipelines → filters to the one whose Development stage holds the Sales dev workspace; captures `sourceStageId` (Development) and `targetStageId` (Test).
2. Confirms the Test stage has an assigned workspace (or asks for a name + capacity to create one).
3. POSTs `deploy` with a `note`, receives `202`, extracts the operation ID.
4. Polls `/v1/operations/{operationId}` until terminal, then reports success and the list of deployed items (or the failure reason).
