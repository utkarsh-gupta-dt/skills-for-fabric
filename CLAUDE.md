# Microsoft Fabric Development Instructions

> **Updates**: `fabric-collection` is a third-party marketplace, so enable auto-update once: run `/plugin`, open **Marketplaces**, select `fabric-collection`, and choose **Enable auto-update**. Administrators can instead set `"autoUpdate": true` on its `extraKnownMarketplaces` entry in managed settings. To update on demand, run `claude plugin update <plugin>@fabric-collection`. If these files were copied in loosely rather than installed as a plugin, compare the local `package.json` version against the remote (`git fetch origin main --quiet && git show origin/main:package.json`) and re-copy if it is newer.

This project uses Microsoft Fabric for data engineering, warehousing, and analytics.

## Architecture Mode

- Use the hybrid layering model: **Agents → Skills → Common**.
- For cross-workload orchestration, start with `agents/FabricDataEngineer.agent.md`.
- Delegate deep endpoint implementation to relevant skills under `skills/`.

## Authentication

All Fabric operations require Azure AD authentication. For development:

```bash
# Login to Azure
az login

# Get token for Fabric REST API
az account get-access-token --resource https://api.fabric.microsoft.com

# Get token for SQL connections (Warehouse, Lakehouse SQL Endpoint)
az account get-access-token --resource https://database.windows.net
```

The `fabric-skills` plugin reuses Azure CLI sign-in for its remote MCPs.
See `mcp-setup/README.md` for prerequisites and older registrations overriding the plugin. Keep access tokens out of chat, logs and saved MCP configuration.

## Fabric REST APIs

All Fabric operations use the REST APIs documented at:
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/fabric/articles/

## Developer vs Consumer Patterns

### Developers
- Use **REST APIs** to create/manage artifacts (workspaces, warehouses, lakehouses)
- Use **protocol-specific** connections to access data:
  - ODBC/JDBC for Warehouse queries
  - Spark/PySpark for Lakehouse data
  - XMLA/DAX for Semantic Models
  - KQL for Real-Time Intelligence

### Consumers
- Use **MCP servers** for natural language queries
- Limited to: Semantic Models, Warehouses, Lakehouse SQL Endpoints
- No ODBC/JDBC setup needed - MCP handles connections

## Best Practices

### Must
- Use Delta Lake format for Lakehouse tables
- Include time filters in KQL queries (`where Timestamp > ago(...)`)
- Use `has` over `contains` for indexed string search in KQL
- Use idempotent KQL commands (`.create-merge table`, `.create-or-alter function`)
- Handle credentials via environment variables or Key Vault
- Use parameterized notebooks and pipelines

### Prefer
- Medallion architecture (Bronze/Silver/Gold) for data organization
- REST APIs for programmatic management
- Incremental processing over full refreshes
- mssparkutils for Fabric-specific notebook operations

### Avoid
- Hardcoded workspace/item IDs
- SELECT * without LIMIT on large tables
- Long-running transactions in Warehouse
- Unbounded streaming queries
